# Backend code created using DRF in django
In this code I have created the backend code for understanding Django serializers and DRF (Django Rest Framework)
This applications contains these features-
1. Model contains articles model, which can be used for todo application. I have also used Django's custom made User model.
2. Serializers are created using Serializer, Model Serializer and HyperlinkedModel Serializer classes.
3. Views are created using api_view functional and class based view, and viewsets, generics and mixins view classes.
4. Token authentication system is also used for User model.
5. Swagger file is also integrated with the backend apis.
